# American Mahjong Engine - JSON Integration Complete ✅

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

Successfully converted the entire American Mahjong engine from hardcoded patterns to a JSON-based rule system using the 2024 Hands.json format.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. JSON Rule Card System
- **`src/rulecard-parser.ts`**: Complete JSON loader that converts 2024 Hands.json into HandPattern objects
- **`load2024RuleCard()`**: Main function to load all 18 hand patterns from JSON
- **Category support**: Handles `year`, `quints`, and `winds-dragons` categories
- **Suit constraint parsing**: Converts JSON suit requirements into `SuitConstraint` objects

### 2. Enhanced Type System  
- **`HandSection`**: New type representing individual sections within patterns
- **`SuitConstraint`**: Enforces "same suit within section, different suits between sections" rules
- **Updated `HandPattern`**: Now supports section-based patterns with flexible suit constraints
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing code still works with new types

### 3. Suit Validation System
- **`src/suit-validator.ts`**: Comprehensive validation for section-based suit constraints
- **`validateSuitConstraints()`**: Core function that enforces American Mahjong suit rules
- **Dragon mapping**: Proper handling of RD (craks), GD (bams), WD (dots) associations
- **Special tile handling**: Flowers, winds, and jokers exempt from suit constraints

### 4. Tile System Enhancements
- **Enhanced `tiles.ts`**: Added suit detection, dragon mapping, and pattern parsing
- **`getTileSuit()`**: Identifies tile suits including special mappings for dragons
- **`getDragonSuit()`**: Maps Red/Green/White dragons to their associated suits
- **`parsePatternToTiles()`**: Converts string patterns into tile arrays

### 5. Integration Updates
- **`src/rulecard.ts`**: Clean integration using JSON-based patterns
- **`src/scoring.ts`**: Updated to use new `validateSuitConstraints()` function  
- **`src/validation.ts`**: Fixed to work with new HandPattern structure
- **`src/engine.ts`**: Integrated with JSON rule card loading

## 🧪 Testing Status

All tests passing ✅ (6 test suites, 21 tests total)
- Rule card loading and parsing
- Suit constraint validation
- Charleston system
- Engine integration
- WebSocket protocols  
- Fairness algorithms

## 📋 JSON Pattern Structure

Each hand pattern now includes:
```typescript
{
  name: string;           // e.g., "2024 CRAKS"
  points: number;         // 25-100 points
  category: HandCategory; // 'year' | 'quints' | 'winds-dragons'
  sections: HandSection[]; // Individual tile groups
  suitConstraints: SuitConstraint[]; // Suit rules between sections
  isOpen: boolean;        // Can claim tiles from others
  allowedJokers: number;  // Maximum jokers allowed
}
```

## 🎮 American Mahjong Rules Implemented

✅ **152-tile set**: Complete American Mahjong tile distribution  
✅ **Charleston passing**: 3-pass tile exchange system  
✅ **JSON-based rule cards**: Flexible pattern loading from JSON  
✅ **Suit constraints**: "Same within section, different between sections"  
✅ **Dragon associations**: RD→craks, GD→bams, WD→dots  
✅ **Special tiles**: Flowers, winds, jokers handled correctly  
✅ **Point scoring**: 25-100 points based on pattern difficulty  

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **Modular design**: Separate concerns (parsing, validation, scoring)  
- **JSON-driven**: Easy to add new rule cards by updating JSON
- **Test coverage**: All core functions validated
- **Build system**: Clean compilation to JavaScript

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The engine is now ready to:
1. Load any 2024-format rule card from JSON
2. Validate hands against complex suit constraint rules
3. Score completed patterns according to American Mahjong rules
4. Handle all special cases (dragons, winds, flowers, jokers)
5. Support multiplayer games through WebSocket integration
